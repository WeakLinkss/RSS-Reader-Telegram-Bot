# RSS Reader Telegram Bot
This is a simple implementation of a RSS reader bot for Telegram written in  Python3.

## How To Config
First, clone this project, then edit `Configs.py` in `bot/utils` directory.
 
 To get `TELEGRAM_TOKEN` you must register a bot with [@BotFather](https://www.google.nl/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwishfnQzazaAhXKKFAKHQESBjMQFggpMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Ftelegram.me%2FBotFather&usg=AOvVaw2Vw6SS_EJSQX2VSgB4fML9).

 For now, this bot only supports MySQL database.

 ## How To Run
 You can simply run `run.sh` script or run `bot/bot.py` and `bot/cron.py` separately.
